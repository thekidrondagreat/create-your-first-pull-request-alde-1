I expect to start this course as a really confused creator, but I should be able to slowly 
get the hang of this as time passes by. I think I can do well in this course. I just need
extra effort to be able to meet my own expectations.

Russ: Yes, I agree. We all learn in our own pace. We can do this! :)
